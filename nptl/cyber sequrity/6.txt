HOW PACKETS ARE transmitted
./virtual circuit
./datagram(mostyly used in internet)
1. virtual circuit Approach --
similar in concept to circuit switching
./a route is established before packets transmission starts
./all packets follow the same path
./the paths are not asigned dedicatedly to a perticular data like circuit switching wich means they can also be shared to another virtual circuits

Virtual Circuit Approach 
./Route is stabilished

./Packet forwarded fromn one node to next using store-and-forward scheme

./each virtual circuit is given its virtual circuit number(known to all the intermediate node when the connection is been stabilished)

./when packets are been transmitted the header will contain only the virtual circuit number

[the path will already be decided for a virual circuit so the routing can be easily done just by the virtual circuit number]
[no dynamic routing decision will be taken by intermediate nodes]
DRAWBACK -- not dynamic or adaptive if the some of the links are loaded already and became slow the path will not be changed
