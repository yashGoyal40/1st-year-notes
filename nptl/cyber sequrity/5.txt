BASICS OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
COMPUTER NETWORK
./its a communication asystem for connecting computers/hosts/devices
WHY??
./better connectivity
./Better communication
./better sharing resources
./bringing people together

TYPES 
./ LAN(small area)---(ususally ethernet)---(faster)---(cheaper)
./ WAN(wide area)---(usually internet)---(slower)---(expencive)

Data Communication in A network
./packet switching
./circuit switching

CIRCUIT SWITCHING 
./a dedicated path is established betwen two stations(fix sequence)
[LOGICAL CHANNEL - guaranee the bandwidth]
.//Connection stabilishment [before the data transmission]
.//Data tranfer[maximum possible speed on a dedicated bandwidth]
.//Connection Termination (after the data tranmition)

./Drawbacks: 
1.channel is dedicated during the entire duration of communication(very inefficient for bursty traffic like data)
(for voice communicztion voice is not transmitted in burst its usually constant it this model works for voice communication)
2. ther is an initial delay(for stabilishment of the connection)


PACKET SWITCHING
(mordern form and widely use for long distance communication)
../Network resources are not dedicated(all links can be shared)

./data is brocken up into smaller chunk called packets
./each packet there is a header which have the information for routing
[Store-and-forward concept]
../Each intermediate network node recives a whole packet
../ the intermediate node decides the route 
../ Forwards the packet along the selected route
./Each intermediate node(router) mantains a [routing table]

ADWATAGES OF PACKER SWITCHING
./link can be shared so link utalisation is better
./Suitable for a computer-genrated(bursty) traffic
./Buffering(storing a data in a buffer and then sharing it to the another data link having diffrent speed) and data convertion can be performed easily
./Some packets may be given priority to the packets
