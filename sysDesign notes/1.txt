distributed system -> multiple servers 

design paterns -> a software design pattern is a genral reusable solution to a commomly occouring problem within a given context in software design

(common problem) -> (common solution)

relaible 
scalable 
reusable 
design

step 1 -> define the problem (document)


product requirements  -> features -> data definitions -> objects -> data base

system should not collapse -> data duplication or load balancing 

extencibility -> how easy is it to change 

build a system that can be  change easly and extend easily with time
