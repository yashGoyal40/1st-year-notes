//what is heap -> complete binary tree


// cbt -
// every level is completely filled exept the last lavel
//every node is added from left (in last lavel)

// max heap/min heap 

// max heap -> root is the biggest 

//min heap -> root is the smalest

/*
implimentation (array)
0th index -> empty
Node -> i index 
left child -> 2*i
right child -> 2*i + 1
parent (i/2)
