//what is a linklinst 
//leniar data dsructure 

//collection of nodes 

//node -> data | address of next node 


//why?  

// vector -> dynamic array (not that optimal)
//array->continious storage 

// ADVANTAGES
// dynamic data sructure can be grown and shrink on run time 
//saves memory 
// no shifting for deletion or insertion 
//not continious storage 



//last block will point at null 

//Types of linl list 

//singly link list 
//doubly LL
