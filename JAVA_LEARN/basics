history of java : sun microsystem {james goslin}
greentalk-> oak(national tree of a lot of countries)(already patented by oak technologies)-> java 
name of coffee:  java coffee
internet programming 
platform indipendent 
completely object oriented 
bytecode {optimised platform indipendent code} (.class file)
made on c++
have a garbage  collector

compiled and interpreted {.java file is compiled by javac compiler all the syntex errors and complie time errors are checked then a .class file is generated that is highly optimised byte code that will further be interpreted insid the jvm}

robust, multithread, distributed, performance(optimised byte code), dynamic

JDK(java devlopment kit )-> jre(java runtime envorenment) + other devlopment tools and compiler 

jre -> jvm + application libraries 

JVM ->  creates a platform to run a java byte code {hence not dependent on operating system}{can not understand .java file}
